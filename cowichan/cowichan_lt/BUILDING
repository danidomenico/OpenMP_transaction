TO BUILD:

1. check out also the folders linuxtuples-1.03/ and cowichan/

2. make sure all three folders (the two above and cowichan_lt) are in the same folder
     $ ls
     cowichan cowichan_lt linuxtuples-1.03

3. Execute the following in linuxtuples-1.03.
     $ pushd linuxtuples-1.03; make all; popd

4. rename linuxtuples.so to liblinuxtuples.so and place it somewhere in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
   placing it in the cowichan_lt folder should be sufficient.
     $ mv linuxtuples-1.03/linuxtuples.so cowichan_lt/liblinuxtuples.so
     or
     $ sudo mv linuxtuples-1.03/linuxtuples.so /usr/lib/liblinuxtuples.so

5. execute the correct build script in cowichan_lt, e.g.
     $ pushd cowichan_lt
     $ chmod +x comp32.sh
     $ ./comp32.sh
     $ popd

TO RUN:

1. in a terminal, execute the tuple server by using the command:
     $ linuxtuples-1.03/tuple_server 25000
   this will run the server on port 25000, on the local host.
   
2. CowichanLT is hard-coded to connect to localhost:25000, so the program should
   run at this point. Note that at this time chaining does not work correctly, due
   to bugs in the LinuxTuples code. See cowichan_lt/src/cowichan_lt.hpp and
   cowichan_lt/src/cowichan_lt.cpp to change the server hostname and port.
   
3. To execute the program, use the command:
     $ cowichan_lt/cowichan_lt
   after building.
