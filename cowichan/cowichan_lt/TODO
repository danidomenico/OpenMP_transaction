Throw out LinuxTuples and replace it with a better tuple-space implementation
(good luck finding one!)
 - Winnow only works with extremely small data sets (e.g. n around 10)
   due to the TCP problems with LinuxTuples at this point.
 - the chain does not work due to buffer overflow errors in the library

Evaluate performance concerns in thresh and winnow (large loops over potential
tuples).

Get rid of inputs/outputs architecture; pass everything in a constructor.

#define off tuple functions so that tuple back-end (e.g. LinuxTuples, ???) can
be changed much more easily in the future.

Add thread-based ability to TupleApplication, and a mixed mode. Provide support
for distributing across different machines, as tuple spaces are inherently
distributed.
