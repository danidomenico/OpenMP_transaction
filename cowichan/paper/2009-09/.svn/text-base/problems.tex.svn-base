\section{The Cowichan Problems\label{s:toys}}

This section describes the problems making up the full problem suite.
As discussed above,
the implementation of each is to be used both as a stand-alone program
and as a module in the chained problem sequence described in Section~\ref{s:issues-chain}.

\input{prob-convex}
\input{prob-gauss}
\input{prob-half}
\input{prob-invperc}
\input{prob-life}
\input{prob-mandel}
\input{prob-norm}
\input{prob-outer}
\input{prob-product}
\input{prob-randmat}
\input{prob-sor}
\input{prob-thresh}
\input{prob-vecdiff}
\input{prob-winnow}
