/**
	This module turns a vector containing point positions into a dense, symmet-
	ric, diagonally dominant matrix by calculating the distances between each
	pair of points. It also constructs a real vector whose values are the distance
	of each point from the origin. Inputs are:

	points: a vector of (x, y) points, where x and y are the pointâ€™s position.
	nelts: the number of points in the vector, and the size of the matrix along
		   each axis.

	Its outputs are:

	matrix: a real matrix, whose values are filled with inter-point distances.
	vector: a real vector, whose values are filled with origin-to-point distances.

	Each matrix element Mi,j such that i != j is given the value di,j, the Eu-
	clidean distance between point i and point j. The diagonal values Mi,i are
	then set to nelts times the maximum off-diagonal value to ensure that the
	matrix is diagonally dominant. The value of the vector element vi is set to
	the distance of point i from the origin, which is given by sqrt(xi^2 + yi^2).
